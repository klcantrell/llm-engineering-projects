       "\n",
       "### Code Breakdown\n",
       "\n",
       "python\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **`yield from`**: \n",
       "   - This is used in Python when you want to delegate part of a generator's operations to another generator. It allows you to yield all values from an iterable (like a set, list, etc.) one by one. \n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Set comprehension**: \n",
       "   - The expression `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` is a set comprehension. A set comprehension creates a set, which is a collection that automatically avoids duplicate values.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Iterating through `books`**: \n",
       "   - `for book in books`: This part of the comprehension loops through each item in `books`. Here, `books` is assumed to be a collection (like a list) of dictionaries, where each dictionary likely represents a book and contains various attributes (like title, author, etc.).\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Getting the author**: \n",
       "   - `book.get(\"author\")`: This retrieves the value associated with the key `\"author\"` from each book dictionary. \n",
       "     - `.get()` is a method that safely accesses a dictionary's key and returns `None` if the key doesn't exist, instead of raising a KeyError.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Filtering out None values**:\n",
       "   - `if book.get(\"author\")`: This condition checks if an author exists (i.e., it is not `None`) before including it in the set. If `book.get(\"author\")` returns `None`, that book will be skipped.\n",
       "\n",
       "### What Does the Code Do?\n",
       "\n",
       "- Essentially, this code is creating a set of unique authors from a list of books while filtering out any books that do not have an author.\n",
       "- By wrapping this in `yield from`, it allows to yield each unique author one at a time from a generator.\n",
       "\n",

       "\n",
       "\n",
       "### Conclusion\n",
       "\n",
       "- The `unique_authors` function processes the `books` list, extracting the `author` field from each book dictionary, filtering out any that are `None`, and then using `yield from` to yield each unique author one at a time.\n",
       "- This is useful when you want to generate a list of authors efficiently without creating a whole list in memory upfront, especially when working with large datasets."

       "=========================\n",

       "The given code snippet is written in Python and utilizes a concept called generators, which produce a series of values over time. Let's break it down:\n",

       "\n",
       "# Dictionary comprehension with a generator expression\n",
       "values = {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "This dictionary comprehension is used to create a new dictionary (`values`) containing only the `author` values from the existing list of dictionaries (`books`). However, instead of creating the entire dictionary at once with all the data, this expression uses generators.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why Use Generators?**\n",
       "---------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "Generators are useful when dealing with large datasets or infinite sequences because they yield values one by one. In Python, you can use the `yield from` keyword, which allows the generator to \"give credit\" to another generator, passing on its generated values instead of having to generate them again.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Code Explaination**\n",
       "---------------------\n",

       "\n",
       "# This line defines a new generator expression.\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's how it works:\n",
       "\n",
       "- `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}` creates an iterator, which generates values on-the-fly.\n",
       "\n",
       "The `yield from` keyword then comes into play. This statement combines the two generators together. It takes all values produced by the sub-generator (`{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}`) and yields them as part of its own sequence.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Equivalent Non-Generator Code**\n",
       "---------------------------------\n",
       "\n",
       "Here's how you might write this using a function to generate the author names directly:\n",
       "\n",
       "\n",
       "def get_authors(books):\n",
       "    authors = []\n",
       "    for book in books:\n",
       "        if book.get(\"author\"):\n",
       "            authors.append(book.get(\"author\"))\n",

       "\n",
       "authors = list(get_authors(books))\n",
